Log on as a non root user with sudo (admin) rights and add a new minima user, set a password and leave the remaining fields as default :

Confirm the new user with y <br>
Give sudo (admin) permissions to the minima user: <br>

## Start your node:
### SET YOUR PASSWORD
âš  Make sure to change the password below from 123 to a secure password using lowercase letters and numbers only of your choice. This will be the password to access your Minidapp Hub.
```bash
docker run -d -e minima_mdspassword=123 -e minima_server=true -v ~/minimadocker9001:/home/minima/data -p 9001-9004:9001-9004 --restart unless-stopped --name minima9001 minimaglobal/minima:latest
```
>- -d: daemon mode, Minima will run in the background <br>
>- -e minima_mdspassword=123 : sets the password for your MiniDapp system to 123. YOU MUST USE A LONG SECURE PASSWORD USING LOWERCASE LETTERS AND NUMBERS ONLY<br>
>- -e minima_server = true : sets your node type as a server node that receives incoming connections<br>
>- -v ~/minimadocker9001:/home/minima/data : creates a local folder called minimadocker9001 in your home directory and maps it to the /home/minima/data directory in Docker. The minimadocker9001 folder is where the Minima database and is also where your backups will be stored.<br>
>- -p 9001-9004:9001-9004 : the port number mapping from your server to the Docker container<br>
>- --restart unless-stopped : ensures your container automatically restarts unless you stop it<br>
>- --name minima9001 : sets the name of your Minima container to minima9001<br>
>- minimaglobal/minima:latest : specifies where to pull the Minima code from<br>

Ensure Docker starts up automatically when the server starts
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
```
```bash
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```
Congratulations! Your Node is up and running. Continue to install the Watchtower to automatically update Minima.
## Automate updates with Watchtower
Start a Watchtower container to automatically update Minima when a new version is available. <br>
```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name watchtower -e WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true -e WATCHTOWER_TIMEOUT=60s -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower
```
Every 24 hours, the Watchtower will check whether there is a new version of Minima and will update if so. <br>

Check Minima and the Watchtower containers are running 
```bash
docker ps
```
