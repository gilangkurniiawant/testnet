# Nulink node setup for Testnet

Thanks to:
>- [NodeX](https://github.com/nodexcapital)


## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Hardware Requirements
 - 3x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
 - 4GB RAM
 - 80GB Disk
 - Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during testnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)

### Recommended Hardware Requirements 
 - 4x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
 - 8GB RAM
 - 200GB of storage (SSD or NVME)
 - Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during testnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)

## Set up your Node ðŸ‘‡
### Automatic Script
You can setup your nulink fullnode in few minutes by using automated script below. It will prompt you to input your validator node name!
```
wget -O nulink.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mggnet/testnet/main/Nulink/nulink.sh && chmod +x nulink.sh && ./nulink.sh
```

### Post-Installation
When installation is finished please load variables into system
```
source $HOME/.bash_profile
```

After running auto Installation you will need to put `Password` Twice.
You will get Information about your key dont forget to SAVE IT ! Its only show once.

## Setup
After running auto install command you will see output that your keystore file is saved in `/root/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.24-972007a5/keystore/UTC-XXXXX`

Change keystore name `UTC-XXXX` into `key` with command `mv` for exampe `mv UTC--2022-09-17T05-27-00.315775527Z--b045627fd6c57577bba32192d8XXXXXXXX key`

Copy the keystore file to nulink directory that we just created 
```
cp <keystore path> /root/nulink
```
Example :
```
cp /root/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.24-972007a5/keystore/key /root/nulink
```
NOTE : IF ERROR TRY TO MAKE NULINK DIRECTORY WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMAND , `cd /root`then `mkdir nulink` , after that try to copy the file again.

### Permission
Give root access, otherwise you will have an error!
```
chmod -R 777 /root/nulink
```
### Set variables
load variables into system
```
export NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<YOUR PASSWORD>

export NULINK_OPERATOR_ETH_PASSWORD=<YOUR PASSWORD>
```
Replace `<YOUR PASSWORD>` with password you entered earlier just so you can remember it.

### Configuration
Set the docker configuration
```
docker run -it --rm \
-p 9151:9151 \
-v /root/nulink:/code \
-v /root/nulink:/home/circleci/.local/share/nulink \
-e NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
nulink/nulink nulink ursula init \
--signer keystore:///code/<Path of the secret key file> \
--eth-provider https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s2.binance.org:8545  \
--network horus \
--payment-provider https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s2.binance.org:8545 \
--payment-network bsc_testnet \
--operator-address <YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS> \
--max-gas-price 100
```
Change `<Path of the secret key file>` With the path of your keystore.
Change `<YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS>` With your public address generated after you use auto install script

Example :
```
docker run -it --rm \
-p 9151:9151 \
-v /root/nulink:/code \
-v /root/nulink:/home/circleci/.local/share/nulink \
-e NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
nulink/nulink nulink ursula init \
--signer keystore:///code/key \
--eth-provider https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s2.binance.org:8545  \
--network horus \
--payment-provider https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s2.binance.org:8545 \
--payment-network bsc_testnet \
--operator-address 0xB045627Fd6c57577Bba32192d8EXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
--max-gas-price 100
```
### Important!
- After that you will get an output of your seed phrase `DONT FORGET TO COPY AND SAVE IT !!!`
- And you will be asked to Confirm your seed phrase , Copy/Paste your saved seed phrase.
- After that you will get confirmation , Just type `y` and enter

This is the output after you complete Configure

You can share your Public address with anyone

## Lets start the node
Then we start the node with the following command (One Command)
```
docker run --restart on-failure -d \
--name ursula \
-p 9151:9151 \
-v /root/nulink:/code \
-v /root/nulink:/home/circleci/.local/share/nulink \
-e NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
-e NULINK_OPERATOR_ETH_PASSWORD \
nulink/nulink nulink ursula run --no-block-until-ready
```

## Security
To protect you keys please make sure you follow basic security rules

### Set up ssh keys for authentication
Good tutorial on how to set up ssh keys for authentication to your server can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-20-04)

### Basic Firewall security
Start by checking the status of ufw.
```
sudo ufw status
```

Sets the default to allow outgoing connections, deny all incoming except ssh and 26656. Limit SSH login attempts
```
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow ssh/tcp
sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp
sudo ufw allow ${GRAVITY_PORT}656,${GRAVITY_PORT}660/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

### Check logs 
To check logs we can use screen to constantly look at the log
```
apt install screen
```
``` 
screen -S log
```
```
docker logs -f ursula
```
Output :

After that your job to run node is complete now lets go to the next step.

# Staking 
- Go to Staking page [https://test-staking.nulink.org/faucet](https://test-staking.nulink.org/faucet)
- Connect your Metamask , You can use any Metamask account
- Get BSC Testnet token in [BNB Faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart) 
- When you get your test BSC now ask for faucet in Nulink Faucet
- Go to [Staking](https://test-staking.nulink.org/) Page and Stake your Nulink and Press Confirm and approve transaction in your Metamask

 Fill the form 
- `Worker Adress` Should be your public address
- `Node Url` Should be your `https://IP:9151/` for Example `https://123.45.67.890:9151/` ( Make sure to Copy everything ! dont miss any `/` Or else you will get an error)
